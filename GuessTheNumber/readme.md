## **Guess the Number Game**

A simple Python game where the player guesses a number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.

## **How It Works**

- The program generates a predefined number (`n = 57` in this case).
- The player has 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
- The program provides feedback after each guess:
  - If the guessed number is **lower** than the target, the program informs the player.
  - If the guessed number is **higher**, the program also lets the player know.
  - When the player guesses the correct number, the game ends with a victory message.
- If the player fails to guess within 10 attempts, the game ends with a failure message.
